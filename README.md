**Video (Youtube Link):** https://youtu.be/c20M6TKEoFE?si=QzM5okdzc8YkWnDV

## Description

I worked on this project with a classmate at the university. Together, we created a 3D simulation of the Grigore Antipa National Museum, built using C++ and OpenGL. While not an exact replica, it features six rooms with different themes:
* Entrance: Museum name on the wall, a man behind a counter, carpets.
* Wild Animals: Various animal models.
* Fishes: Fish models placed on pedestals, wall paintings.
* Birds: Various bird models, a rotating eagle.
* Outdoor: An outdoor area with flowers, a statue labeled as Grigore Antipa, and paintings.
* Dinosaurs: Dinosaur models with informational wall texts.
  
The simulation lacks collision detection, lighting, and shadows.

## Technologies Used

* C++.
* OpenGL.
* GLEW.
* GLFW.
* ASSIMP.

## My Contributions
* Fishes room.
* Outdoor.
* Dinosaurs room.
* Switch between rooms controls.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
* Visual Studio (with C++ development tools).
* GLEW, GLFW, and ASSIMP.

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**  
git clone https://github.com/AndreiCIlies/Grigore_Antipa_National_Museum.git

**2. Open the project in Visual Studio**  
Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and open the .sln file.

**3. Configure Dependencies**  
- Link GLEW, GLFW, and ASSIMP libraries.
- Ensure OpenGL is enabled.

**4. Build the project**
